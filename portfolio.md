# Portfolio

## Featured Projects
### [Imitation Learning for Robotic Arm Movement](projects/imitation-learning.md)
Developed a CNN-based system for robotic manipulation using PyTorch and ROS.

### [Fine-Tuning Stable Diffusion for Multi-Object Image Generation](projects/stable-diffusion.md)
Enhanced DreamBooth to support multi-object generation with optimized hyperparameters.

### [Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)](projects/nerf.md)
Trained a neural network to generate volumetric density and color of a model car from arbitrary viewpoints.

### [Primitive-Based Stylization of Images](projects/image-stylization.md)
Implemented a hill-climbing algorithm to stylize images using 3D brush stroke primitives.

More projects will be added soon!
