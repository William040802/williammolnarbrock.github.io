# Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)

## Overview
**Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)** is a project that generates volumetric density and color for objects using 2D image data. This implementation trains a branched neural network to create a 3D representation of a scene.

## Features
- Generates synthetic 5D training data from 2D images.
- Reconstructs high-fidelity volumetric density and color representations.
- Trains on datasets of model objects to generate views from arbitrary points.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV
- **Key Concepts**: Ray tracing, volumetric rendering, neural networks

## Repository
- Explore the source code and implementation details on GitHub:  
  [Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)](https://github.com/William040802/Neural-Radiance-Field)

## Applications
- High-quality 3D reconstructions for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
- Enhancing visual effects in media and entertainment industries.
- Developing realistic training datasets for machine learning applications.
