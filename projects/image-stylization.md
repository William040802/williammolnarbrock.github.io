# Image Primitive Stylization

## Overview
This project focuses on **stylizing images using 3D brush stroke primitives**, developed in collaboration with a research team. By using a hill-climbing algorithm, the system creates artistic representations of input images by simulating brush strokes with varying sizes, angles, and textures.

## Features
- **3D Brush Stroke Simulation**: Converts 2D image elements into 3D primitives.
- **Hill-Climbing Algorithm**: Optimizes the placement and properties of each stroke for a cohesive artistic style.
- **Modular Framework**: Allows customization of styles and parameters for varied outputs.

## Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Key Algorithms**: Hill-climbing for optimization

## Applications
- Generating artistic representations for digital media.
- Creating stylized data for AI training models in creative applications.
